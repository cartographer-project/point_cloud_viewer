# Point viewer

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/googlecartographer/point_cloud_viewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/googlecartographer/point_cloud_viewer) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/googlecartographer/point_cloud_viewer/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is a standalone project to make viewing massive point clouds easy and convenient.
It was build to serve the needs of the [Cartographer](https://github.com/googlecartographer) project, but is useful in its own right.

## Building

The project consist of a root crate that can build and read octrees on disk and viewer binaries to visualize the data.

First, install Rust: `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`.
See <https://rustup.rs> for details.

### Creating Octrees

In the root of the repo, run `cargo build --release`.
Then use `target/release/build_octree` to generate an octree out of a PLY file.

If you want to develop and change the `.proto` files you will also need to [install the code generation from rust-protobuf](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/).
For now, the generated rust code is checked in and needs to be regenerated manually.

### Web Viewer

The `web_viewer` consists of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) code running in the browser and a web server binary.

To build,

1. Change into the client directory: `cd client`.
2. Install npm. We strongly suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
3. Install javascript dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Build the client: `npm run build`.

Then build the server: `cargo build --release`.
Serve up the octree using `target/release/web_viewer <octree directory>`, open Chrome to <http://localhost:5433>, navigate with WASD and left-click-drag on the mouse.
The mouse wheel adjusts movement speed.

The client files (HTML and JavaScript) are embedded in the `web_viewer` binary, so it is fully stand alone.

### SDL client (experimental)

This is a native client using [SDL2](https://libsdl.org).
It is a new tool and incomplete.
For now, prefer the web viewer.

Build with `cargo build --release`, run with `target/release/sdl_viewer <octree directory>`.

## Prior art

This work was inspired through the following projects.

- [Potree](http://potree.org)
- [Megatree](http://wiki.ros.org/megatree)
